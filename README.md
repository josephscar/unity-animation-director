# UnitySequencerTool
A tool for sequencing spawning non variable prefabs and FX for cinematic sequences and animations. Acts as an alternative to animation event keyframes or timeline activation events and streamlines these concepts into one easy to use GUI tool.

Developed for use in 3D environments.
